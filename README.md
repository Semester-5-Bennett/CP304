Problem Statement:
Let 100 people are randomly standing in the Bennett University campus of size 10000*10000 m2.
Their 2-D locations (x, y) are given in an array. Determine the largest size sub-array of persons and the starting position from which all following persons are in a sorted order.
Input:
1. The first line contains the number of points n
2. The second line contains n 2-D coordinates points (Ã— y) separated by a new line
Output:
1. The largest sub-array size and its starting position.
Constraints:
1.2 <= n <= 100
2. -10000 <= (x, y) co-ordinate <= 10000
Note: The row starts from the first position.
Hint: In case if we get more than one sub-array as outputs, then the sub-array having higher starting position will be considered as a final output.

Sample Input-1
7
1.2 4.5
1.0 3.5
1.4 3.8
1.1 2.0
2.5 2 5
3.5 3.2
3.7 2.75
Output-1
3, 4
Explanation The first output value 3 is the size of sub-array and the 4 is a starting position of this sub-array.


#In the solution section there are 3 test cases one of them will be uncommented to run the one test case 
you have to comment the rest of 2 test cases to run the one test case it apply  for all the test cases.
